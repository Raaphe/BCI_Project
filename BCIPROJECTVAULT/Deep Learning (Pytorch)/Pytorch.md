## What is PyTorch?
---

- Most popular research deep learning framework*
- Write fast deep learning code in Python (able to run on a GPU/many GPUs)
- Able to access many pre-built deep learning models (Torch Hub/[torchvision.models](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.9/models.html))
- Whole stack: preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application/cloud.
- Originally designed and used in-house by Facebook/Meta (now open-source and used by companies such as Tesla, Microsoft, OpenAI)
