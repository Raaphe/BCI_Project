This will be the course I will follow to learn how to process brain wave datasets using a model I will train that will theoretically operate using quantum algorithms. This is super mega ambitious but hopefully I get things done, have fun, and learn stuff.

### 1. Quantum Computation

1. [ ] [Microsoft Katas](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/experience/quantum-katas)

> Learning Q# will not be needed to make a QML but I will go through for the heck of it as well as to try to get a better understanding of quantum computing in general.

# 2. Machine Learning

1. [ ] [25h Youtube Course Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=43s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

This video looks fairly complete and will run me through what I think I need to master `pytorch`. Looks pretty consumable and could be done watching in a week or two. 
# 3. QML (Quantum Machine Learning)

 1. [ ]  [Penny Lane](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/interfaces/torch.html)

The end goal of this project will be to process brain waves (P300 (I think)) to have someone control a BCI. We will do this using a pi and a piEEG that will use a QML to interpret the brain signals.
