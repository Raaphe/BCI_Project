This will be the course I will follow to learn how to process brain wave datasets using a model I will train that will theoretically operate using quantum algorithms. This is super mega ambitious but hopefully I get things done, have fun, and learn stuff.

### 1. Quantum Computation

> Learning Q# will not be needed to make a QML but I will go through for the heck of it as well as to try to get a better understanding of quantum computing in general.

# 2. Machine Learning

1. [ ] [PyTorch Docs](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
2. [ ] [Youtube Theory Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
3. [ ] [Training for ML](https://www.kaggle.com/)

# 3. QML (Quantum Machine Learning)

 1. [ ]  [Penny Lane](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/interfaces/torch.html)

The end goal of this project will be to process brain waves (P300 (I think)) to have someone control a BCI. We will do this using a pi and a piEEG that will use a QML to interpret the brain signals.
