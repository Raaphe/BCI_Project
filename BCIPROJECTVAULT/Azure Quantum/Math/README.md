This section will include scanned images of my written notes for this section as math exercises are easier to complete using pen and paper as well as the digital documentation provided by Microsoft in their kata training. The advantage of having digital notes will be the convenience of code samples whereas for plain pen and paper will be the convenience of free hand drawing and writing symbols, numbers, equations wherever I please. For best viewing experience of the computer notes please use a markdown editor that has support for mathXML.

PS : For the written notes, I will write in black ink the sections of theory and in blue ink the section for practice and exercises. (my handwriting isn't the best)
