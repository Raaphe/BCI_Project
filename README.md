# BCI project 2024-2025

This repository will host the research I have done to complete a BCI in collaboration with Marie-Victorin's IT department. The development will start during winter break when we will have complete access to the PiEEG.
The idea is that a PiEEG will read one's EEG signals (probably P300), allowing the user to control a simple web interface with only thoughts. There will be a training/setup phase where each user will have to teach our model what their EEGs look like when they want to trigger certain events. This will be better documented in a paper coming soon.
